Meta-Data, Merupakan desciptif informasi sebuah data base

Constructing the database is the process of storing the data 
on some storage medium that is controlled by the
DBMS

The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog 
separately from the access programs Program-data independence
using DML(select) :

Mengunakan concurrency control agar pemasukan data tidak bertabrakan

A transaction is an executing program or process that 
includes one or more database accesses, such as reading 
or updating of database records

Database is a collection of related data

DBMS is a general purpose software system that facilitates : Defining, Contructing, Manipulating, Sharing.


ADVANTAGES OF USING THE DBMS APPROACH
- Controlling redundancy
- Restricting unauthorized access
- Providing storage structures for efficient query processing
- Providing backup and recovery
- Enforcing integrity constraints


The description of a database is called the database schema
The data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database state or snapshot
It is also called the current set of occurrences or instances in the database


ENFORCING INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS :
    Data type constraint specifies a data type for each data item
    Referential integrity constraint specifies that a record in one file must be related to records in other files
    Key constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values


Data Definition Language (DDL) : CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP
Data Manipulation Language (DML) : SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DATABASE SYSTEM UTILITIES:
    Loading utility is used to load existing data files into the database
    Backup utility creates a backup copy of the database, usually by dumping the entire database onto tape
    Database storage reorganization utility can be used to reorganize a set of database files into a different file organization to improve performance
    Performance monitoring utility monitors database usage and provides statistics to the DBA



SYNTAX :

AS (SELECT id, name AS title FROM movies);
